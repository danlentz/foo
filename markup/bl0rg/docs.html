    <h1>Gigamonkeys Markup</h1>
    <p>This library is based on the code I used while writing <i>Practical
    Common Lisp</i> to generate both PDFs (which I used for my own
    proofreading purposes) and the HTML version of the book that is
    available on the web at <a href='http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/'>http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/</a>.</p>
    <p>I had two goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To be able to work in Emacs yet not have to embed an incredible
      amount of formatting gunk in my text while I worked on it.</li>
      <li>To be able to generate output in multiple forms, initially PDF
      and HTML and later (when it came time to turn stuff in to Apress)
      RTF.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the end I settled on a mix of TeX-style markup (such as \i{...} to
    indicate italic) and various kinds of Wiki-inspired markup such as
    indicating new paragraphs by separating them with blank lines and
    inferring the style of certain paragraphs from their indentation. And
    because part of the point was to be able to write in Emacs I decided
    to make my markup language grok Emacs's outline-mode headers, lines
    prefixed by a number of <code>*</code>'s. I found this to be a pleasing
    format for writing</p>
    <h2>Parsing</h2>
    <p>The code here is a somewhat cleaned up version of the code I actually
    used while working on the book. The markup language itself is
    implemented in <code>parser.lisp</code>. The function <code>PARSE-FILE</code>
    takes a pathname designator and returns a list of s-expressions
    representing the parse tree. For instance if the file
    <code>sample.txt</code> contained the following:</p>
    <pre>
* A Sample
    </pre>
    <pre>
Here is a paragraph. Here's a sentence with some \i{formatting} in
it. And another sentence.
    </pre>
    <pre>
And this is another paragraph.
    </pre>
    <p>then <code>(parse-file "sample.txt")</code> would return this:</p>
    <pre>
((:H1 "A Sample")
 (:P "Here is a paragraph. Here's a sentence with some "
  (:I "formatting") " in" #\Newline "it. And another sentence.")
 (:P "And this is another paragraph." #\Newline))
    </pre>
    <p>The <code>:H1</code> tag is derived from the number of asterisks leading the
    line <code>"A Sample"</code>; the <code>:P</code> tags are inferred from the lack of
    any other tag; and the <code>:I</code> tag is taken from the name between
    the <code>\</code> and the <code>{</code>.</p>
    <p>For the most part, the parser doesn't care about the names used as
    tag names in the <code>\<i>name</i>{...</code>} syntax. However it does need to
    know whether a given tag name is the name of paragraph tag (which can
    appear where an untagged paragraph can) or a subdocument tag (which is
    parsed like the document as a whole and thus can contain
    paragraphs). It recognizes tags as being one of these two types using
    the variables <code>*PARAGRAPH-TAGS*</code> and <code>*SUBDOCUMENT-TAGS*</code>
    which are defined in <code>parameters.lisp</code> and can be bound or set as
    you see fit.<sup>1</sup></p>
    <h2>Rendering</h2>
    <p>The files <code>pdf.lisp</code> and <code>html.lisp</code> each provide
    implementations of the generic function <code>RENDER-AS</code> which takes
    an argument indicating the type of output, (either <code>:pdf</code> or
    <code>:html</code>), an s-expression as returned by <code>PARSE-FILE</code>, and
    the name of the output file. The public interface to <code>RENDER-AS</code>
    is the function <code>RENDER</code> which takes a an output type indicator,
    the name of an input file, and, optionally, the name of an output file
    which is otherwise derived from the name of the input file with the
    the output type as the file extension. Thus this documentation which
    is in the file <code>docs.txt</code> is rendered into PDF as:</p>
    <pre>
MARKUP&gt; (render :pdf "docs.txt")
#P"/Users/peter/projects/lisp-libraries/development/markup/docs.pdf"
    </pre>
    <p>New output formats can be defined simply by defining a new method on
    <code>RENDER-AS</code> specialized on a different output type.</p>
    <h2>Possible improvements</h2>
    <p><b>Styles</b> The current PDF rendering hard-wires assumptions about how
    to render different document elements. And the HTML rendering simply
    provides a way to map from document elements to HTML tags (possibly
    with attributes), defaulting to mapping to the HTML tag of the same
    name. Ideally there'd be a way to express style information and define
    a mapping from the markup elements to the rendering style without
    changing the code. Even more ideally it'd be possible to reuse that
    same style information with different back-ends. Which I have some
    ideas about but which I've not done anything about yet.</p>
    <p><b>Footnotes</b> In both the PDF and HTML renderer, footnotes are
    generated as end-notes. This is probably the best you can do for HTML
    but in the PDF renderer it'd be nice to be able to place notes as true
    footnotes. However this is a non-trivial problem because making room
    for a footnote at the bottom of a page affects what body text fits on
    the page which can affect what footnotes should appear on that
    page. In the worst case scenario putting a footnote on a page causes
    the text containing the footnote reference to no longer fit on the
    page meaning the footnote shouldn't go on that page after all. So you
    take it off but now the footnote reference is back on the page. And so
    on.</p>
    <p><b>Other output formats</b> When working on the book I implemented an
    incredibly hacky RTF generator that allowed me to produce RTF
    documents with all the Apress styles appropriately applied since I
    ultimately had to turn in Word files to Apress. I'd like to clean that
    up and add it back in in some form because there's nothing better than
    not having to use Microsoft Word.</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>In theory all you need to do to use this library are grab the
    distribution, unpack it, and arrange for ASDF to know about the
     file, either by adding a symlink to it from a directory
    that is already in <code>asdf:*central-registry*</code> or by adding the
    directory created when you unpack the distribution to
    <code>asdf:*central-registry*</code>. You'll also need my FOO library (which
    is documented in Chapters
    <a href='http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-an-html-generation-library-the-interpreter.html'>30</a>
    and
    <a href='http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-an-html-generation-library-the-compiler.html'>31</a>
    of <i>Practical Common Lisp</i> and a couple libraries it depends on. All
    these are also loadable using ASDF. And, of course, to render PDF
    files you'll need Marc Battyani's excellent CL-PDF and CL-TYPESETTING
    libraries. Those libraries are available here:</p>

    <p><sup>1. </sup>In general subdocument tags are used for two kinds
    of things.</p>
    <p>The first are tags used to delimit content that can be embedded in a
    paragraph but which may need to themselves consist of multiple
    paragraphs. Footnotes such as this one are a prime example.</p>
    <p>The other kind of subdocument elements are structural elements such as
    lists and tables that consists entirely of other tagged elements. If
    you want to use the tags <code>\bullets{...}</code> and <code>\item{...}</code> to
    indicate a bulleted list, you should add <code>:bullets</code> to
    <code>*SUBDOCUMENT-TAGS*</code> and <code>:item</code> to <code>*PARAGRAPH-TAGS*</code>.</p>
